# Libraries used #

## lua ##

Lua is a scripting programming language. A characteristic feature of Lua is implementation of a large number of program entities with a minimum of syntactic means.

Thus, all composite user data types (arrays, structures, sets, queues, lists) are implemented through the mechanism of tables, and the mechanisms of object-oriented programming, including multiple inheritance, are implemented using metatables, which are also responsible for overloading operations and a number of other features.
Lua is a procedural dynamically typed modular language with automatic memory management. Includes basic elements to support functional and object programming styles. Thus, Lua can be called a multi-paradigm language. Built-in parallel programming tools allow you to write multithreaded programs only by means of the language, without accessing the operating system API or external libraries.

Since the main purpose of Lua is embedding, it has effective means of interlanguage interaction, focused mainly on calling C libraries and working in a C environment. The language supports a small number of built-in data types: boolean values, numbers, strings, functions, streams. There are no typical combined data structures, such as arrays, sets, lists, and records; instead of all of them, one basic Lua structure is used a table.

A separate type of *userdata* is designed specifically for low-level programming and data exchange with external code in other languages. Functions in Lua are objects of the first class, can be assigned and passed in parameters. Closures are supported, it is possible to create higher-order functions. The object system is prototypical, there is no explicit support for inheritance, but it is easily implemented using metatables.

## tolua++ ##

Tolua is a tool that greatly simplifies the integration of C/C++ code with Lua. Based on a cleaned header file, tolua automatically generates the binding code to access C/C++ features from Lua. Using Lua API and tag method facilities, tolua maps C/C++ constants, external variables, functions, classes, and methods to Lua.
To use tolua, create a package file, a C/C++ cleaned header file, listing the constants, variables, functions, classes, and methods to want to export to the Lua environment. Then tolua parses this file and creates a C/C++ file that automatically binds the C/C++ code to Lua. If link the created file with our application, the specified C/C++ code can be accessed from Lua.

## zlib ##

Zlib is a software library used for data compression and is an abstraction of the DEFLATE compression algorithm used in their gzip file compression program.

## subhook ##

SubHook is a simple hooking library for C and C++ that works on Windows, Linux and macOS. It supports x86 only (32-bit and 64-bit).

## cxxopts ##

Cxxopts is a lightweight C++ option parser library, supporting the standard GNU style syntax for options.

Detailed information can be obtained [here](https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts).

## googletest ##

Google Test is a library for unit testing in C++. Google Test is built on the xUnit testing methodology, that is, when individual parts of the program (classes, functions, modules) are tested separately from each other, in isolation. The library itself is developed with the active use of testing, when adding any parts to the official version, in addition to the code of the changes themselves, it is necessary to write a set of tests to confirm their correctness.

## google benchmark ##

Google benchmark is a microbenchmark support library. The library can be used with C++03. However, it requires C++11 to build, including compiler and standard library support.
